# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The setup script will:
- Install Homebrew and system dependencies
- Set up Python 3.11 virtual environment
- Clone and configure MCP servers
- Install Playwright for browser automation
- Install dashboard dependencies

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your API keys
nano .env
```

Required configuration:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
UBER_EATS_EMAIL=your_uber_eats_email@example.com
UBER_EATS_PASSWORD=your_uber_eats_password
```

### 3. Start the System

```bash
# Start all services
./scripts/start.sh

# Or use just for development
just dev
```

## 🔧 MCP Architecture - Two-Stage System

### Fast Taco Search MCP Server
**Lightning-fast restaurant discovery powered by Anthropic Claude**

- **SQLite Database**: Pre-compiled Austin taco restaurant data with reviews and ratings
- **Semantic Search**: Claude analyzes entire database for intelligent matching
- **Sub-second Response**: Database queries return results in <100ms
- **Smart Matching**: "steak tacos" matches "carne asada", "beef", "bistec" automatically
- **Review Analysis**: Claude reads customer reviews to find perfect matches

**Available Search Functions:**
- `search_tacos()` - General taco restaurant search
- `intelligent_search()` - AI-powered semantic search with review analysis
- `get_restaurant_details()` - Detailed info including hours, ratings, reviews
- `get_top_rated_tacos()` - Best-rated restaurants with minimum review threshold
- `search_by_area()` - Location-based search for Austin neighborhoods

### Uber Eats Fulfillment MCP Server
**Focused order placement and fulfillment**

- **Browser Automation**: Headless Chrome with Playwright for real ordering
- **Order Fulfillment**: Takes restaurant + item details from search results
- **Multi-item Orders**: Place complex orders with multiple items
- **Real-time Status**: Background processing with progress updates
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic and failure reporting

**Order Functions:**
- `order_food()` - Place single item orders with direct URLs
- `place_multiple_items_order()` - Order multiple items from same restaurant
- Background processing with WebSocket status updates

### Integration Flow
1. **Voice Input** → Claude processes natural language
2. **Search Phase** → Fast Taco Search MCP finds restaurants instantly
3. **Selection** → User chooses from search results
4. **Order Phase** → Uber Eats MCP fulfills the actual order
5. **Tracking** → Real-time updates via WebSocket

## 🎤 Voice Commands

The system understands natural language taco orders:

```
"I want three al pastor tacos from Uber Eats"
"Order two carne asada tacos with extra salsa"
"Get me some chicken tacos"
"Find the best steak tacos in downtown Austin"
"Search for spicy beef tacos with good reviews"
"Check the status of my last order"
```
